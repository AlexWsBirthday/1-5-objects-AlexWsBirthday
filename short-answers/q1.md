# Question

When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer

Since arrays are _ordered_ lists of data types, it'd be best to use arrays when consecutive order matters (such as listing months in order, timed events, what came first to last or last to first). Arrays however, aren't that readable. Objects are much more reader-friendly, and can store many specifically labeled data types. Thus, objects are best used when creating a thing when breaking down information about more complex data (such as breaking down the parts of a car, the members of a team and their data, etc.)
