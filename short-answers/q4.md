# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and it is the format used to represent data for either storing or transporting purposes. The reason why the example below is not valid JSON is because the key names are not surrounded by double quotes.
