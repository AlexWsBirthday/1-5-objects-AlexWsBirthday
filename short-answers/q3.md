# Question

What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer

A shallow clone is a clone of an object that only truly copies primitive data types and only _references_ to more complex data types (such as arrays). This can cause bugs because when you try to reference a more complex data type in the property of a shallow clone, it won't return the data you're trying to reference. You need a deep clone for that.
