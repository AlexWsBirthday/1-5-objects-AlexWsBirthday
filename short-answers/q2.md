# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Passing by reference means that methods and functions access the specific location in memory where the value is stored. So any changes done through pass-by-reference, change the original value because it is referencing the location-- it is mutable. Whereas pass-by value signals that changes are done to a copy of the value, where it is stored separately from the original source value. The original value will remain untouched.
